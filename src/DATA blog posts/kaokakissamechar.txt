In January, on my way to New York to attend my first BSI weekend, a young man sitting beside me on the plane asked me what a Sherlockian was. 
How does one explain to the uninitiated what it means to be a Sherlockian? 
It's a strange concept and difficult to make clear. 
Being a Sherlockian is a way of life and a philosophy. 
Some might even call it a religion since the tales of Sherlock Holmes are referred to as the Canon. 
Reading and studying these sacred writings alter one's perspec1ive of the world and oneself. 
For many, just the utterance of the name Sherlock Hoimes releases endorphins and brings a natural high-the great detective is a seven-per-cent solution, and we have withdrawal symptoms when we are denied our fix. 
Who can become a Sherlockian? 
Anyone who reads, studies, and applies his teachings can achieve this feat. 
The great detective constantly reminds his friend Watson. "You know my methods. Apply them." 
However, being a Sherlockian is more than just applying the master's techniques. 
This is a journey of self-discovery, and for me, one that has been lifelong.
