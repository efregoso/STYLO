Yesterday was the date generally recognized as Sherlock Holmes' birthday.
People all across the world celebrated in their own ways.
I was lucky enough to have breakfast and then lunch with two different groups of Sherlockians for very different purposes.
I can't imagine a better way to celebrate the Great Detective's birthday than spending time with other Sherlockians.
Steve and Rusty Mason of Dallas' scion society, The Crew of the Barque Lone Star, were passing through the St. Louis area on their way to the BSI Weekend in New York.
They had dinner Friday night with some members of The Harpooners of the Sea Unicorn and The Parallel Case of St. Louis, but I was unable to attend.
Luckily for me, they wanted to meet the next morning and we had a great time.
I'd never met either of these guys in person before, but I work with Steve on The Beacon Society and have communicated with him a lot.
After two and a half hours, we had to break up our little get together so they could get on the road, and I had my next appointment for the day.
I gave them a copy of The Criminal Mastermind
